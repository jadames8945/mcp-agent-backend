**CRITICAL: 95%+ ACCURACY REQUIREMENT**
Your refinements must be COMPREHENSIVE and PRECISE. Missing details will cause workflow failures.
"""

VALIDATION_TASKS = """
**COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION AND REFINEMENT TASKS:**

1. **TOOL NAME VALIDATION:**
   - Verify the tool_name exists in the available tools list
   - Check for exact matches (case-sensitive, including dashes/underscores)
   - If tool_name is invalid, correct it to the closest valid tool name
   - If no valid tool name found, return the original tool invocation unchanged

2. **RANK PRESERVATION:**
   - ALWAYS preserve the original rank from the input tool invocation
   - NEVER change the rank value
   - The rank determines execution order and must remain unchanged

3. **PARAMETER SCHEMA COMPLIANCE:**
   - STRICTLY respect the tool's parameter schema from the available_tools list
   - ONLY use parameters that are explicitly listed in the tool's parameter list
   - NEVER add extra parameters that aren't defined in the tool's parameter list
   - Preserve the exact parameter names and types as defined in the tool
   - If a tool only accepts 'ticker', don't add 'instruction' or other parameters

4. **COMPREHENSIVE INPUT EXTRACTION:**
   - Extract ALL specific details from user input (names, IDs, emails, numbers, etc.)
   - Extract ALL specific details from previous_result (fund data, research findings, etc.)
   - Extract ALL specific details from chat_history that are relevant
   - NEVER miss important identifiers like table IDs, email addresses, fund tickers, etc.

5. **DETAILED PARAMETER ENHANCEMENT:**
   - For 'instruction' parameters: Include ALL extracted details in natural language
   - For 'instruction' parameters: Always include specific names, IDs, numbers, and context
   - For 'instruction' parameters: Make instructions COMPLETE and ACTIONABLE
   - For 'ticker' parameters: Use the exact ticker symbol, don't add extra text
   - Preserve existing parameter structure but enhance ALL values with missing details

6. **PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:**
   - If user mentions a table ID (e.g., "tbl7S5yckqCPMR02R"), ALWAYS include it in the instruction
   - If user mentions an email address, ALWAYS include it in the instruction
   - If previous_result contains fund data, ALWAYS include fund name, ticker, and key metrics
   - If previous_result contains research data, ALWAYS include the topic and key findings
   - NEVER use generic phrases like "data from previous result" - always be specific

7. **COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT INTEGRATION:**
   - Combine user input + previous_result + chat_history into complete instructions
   - Ensure ALL mentioned entities (people, places, things, numbers) are included
   - Make instructions self-contained and complete
   - Include both the WHAT (action) and the HOW (specific details)

EXAMPLES = """
**EXAMPLES OF HIGH-QUALITY REFINEMENTS:**

**Finance Tool Example:**
Original: input_data={{'ticker': 'VGTSX'}}, rank=2
User Input: "find info on the following tickers VGTSX, ITOT, AEPFX, VTSAX, and FMAGX"
Tool Parameters: [{{'param_name': 'ticker', 'type': 'string'}}]
Refined: input_data={{'ticker': 'VGTSX'}}, rank=2 (keep original, don't add extra parameters, preserve rank)

**Airtable Example:**
Original: "Create a new row in the mutual funds tracker table", rank=3
User Input: "using previous data take info AEPFX and within mutual funds tracker, create a new row for table id tbl7S5yckqCPMR02R"
Previous Result: "AEPFX - American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund has $123.4B in assets, 0.84% expense ratio, 3-star Morningstar rating"
Tool Parameters: [{{'param_name': 'instruction', 'type': 'string'}}]
Refined: "Create a new row in the mutual funds tracker table (ID: tbl7S5yckqCPMR02R) for AEPFX - American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund with the following details: $123.4B in assets, 0.84% expense ratio, and 3-star Morningstar rating", rank=3

**Email Example:**
Original: "Send an email with previous results", rank=1
User Input: "get info on agentic ai and email previous results as body to email johnsmith123@gmail.com"
Previous Result: "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals..."
Tool Parameters: [{{'param_name': 'instruction', 'type': 'string'}}]
Refined: "Send an email to johnsmith123@gmail.com with the subject 'Agentic AI Information' and include the following content in the body: Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals. Key concepts include autonomous decision-making, goal-oriented behavior, and the ability to take actions without human intervention.", rank=1

CRITICAL_RULES = """
**CRITICAL RULES FOR 95%+ ACCURACY:**
- ALWAYS preserve the original rank from the input tool invocation
- NEVER change the rank value - it determines execution order
- ALWAYS include specific identifiers (table IDs, email addresses, fund tickers, etc.)
- ALWAYS include quantitative data (amounts, percentages, ratings, etc.)
- ALWAYS include descriptive details (names, classifications, etc.)
- NEVER use generic references like "previous data" or "the results"
- ALWAYS make instructions complete and self-contained
- ALWAYS preserve the exact parameter structure
- ALWAYS validate tool names against available tools
- NEVER add parameters that aren't in the tool's schema
- ALWAYS read the tool's parameter list from available_tools
